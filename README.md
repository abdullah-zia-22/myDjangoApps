Apps for Personal Use
EnhanceImage app enhances images using machine learning CNN's and GAN's. I'm using my personal API access key. You can get your at DeepAI.org. Place that access api token in EnhanceImage views.py file
VideoDownloader includes facebook and instagram downloader. Facebook Downloader uses my personal cookies it means only i can download private videos from my followed groups/poeple. It means it only works with cookies file. I'm placing empty txt file for obvious security reasons. For public use, Place/replace "Cookies.txt" file with your "cookies.txt" file. This file can be created using a chrome extension called "cookies.txt". Goto Website, run extenstion, it'll automatically generate cookies for that website. Place that txt file in VideoDownloader folder. InstaDownloader uses a library which require username and password. No Need to worry, credentials are safe. It does not saves any informations.
If you want to add your cookies or api file to deployed App, feel free to contact me!
